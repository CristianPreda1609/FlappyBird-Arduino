# Flappy Bird

## Introduction
**Flappy Bird** is a classic mobile game where players control the upward movement of a bird navigating through a series of obstacles. These obstacles consist of pairs of vertically aligned pipes with a gap between them, positioned against a scrolling landscape. The objective is to avoid collisions with the pipes or the edges of the screen. Each successful passage through a pair of pipes increases the player's score and gradually accelerates the game's speed, making it increasingly challenging as the game progresses.
